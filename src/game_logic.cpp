// just go ahead! You are free (and encouraged) to use them to make your code clearer and more integrated.
// Or... can you?
// Just don't modify the signatures of existing functions.

// Don't try to use extern variables from user_logic.cpp. You're not supposed to communicate through this way.
// After all, the game logic on the online judger won't contain extern variables same as yours.
// You are free to add helper functions.
